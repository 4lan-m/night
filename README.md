# Night

A (interpreted?) programming language. Still in development. I've never made one before, so I don't really know what I'm doing, but it should work out in the end.

The `source.night` file is where you write the code. But I don't like the extention `.night`. I'm looking for something shorter, but don't know what yet. I'm also working on a logo, but I'm really bad at designing. I'm thinking of something similar to `logo2.png`.

Also, this language is very similar to the C family since I'm not that creative, and I'm just starting out. Definitly going to change it down the road.

**Special Features (updated as progress continues):**

- no implicit conversions (similar to Rust)

**Language features**

You can check the `source.night` file for what the language currently supports. It's really basic stuff. Variable initialization, a `print` thingy, and simple expressions.

Edit: I just added a new feature, if statements!

**In progress**

A complete rework of the language and code. Also I want to add functions. And if I do, then in theory, I could use my language, to create my language (well, pre-defined functions at least)...
