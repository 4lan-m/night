# Night

An (interpreted?) programming language. Still in development. I've never made one before, so I don't really know what I'm doing, but it should work out in the end.

The `source.night` file is where you write the code. I'm also working on a logo, but I'm really bad at designing. I'm also thinking of making a website once it's done.

Also, this version isn't stable at all. This upcoming weekend however, I'll release a stable version :)

---

**Language features**

- variable declaration, initialization, and assignment
- expressions (integer and boolean)
- print thingy (standard ouput)
- if statements (if, else if, and else)

**In progress**

I'm working on refactoring my entire code and fixing a bunch of things. Don't really know what I'm doing. I'm also working on functions, and once I get those done, then in theory, I could use my language, to create my language (well, pre-defined functions at least)...

Oh, also, major update in the upcomming weekend! You'll see a lot of bug fixes, and better error messages! And, that version will be stable!

**Example**

This is what the stable version will (hopefully) look like this weekend :)

```
print "Hello World!";

// this is a comment

bit boolean = true; // supports `! && || == !=` all of those
syb character = 'c';
int integer = 2 + 3; // supports '+ - / * % ( )' all of those
dec float = 3.14;
str string = "dynamic " + "squid"; // supports string concatenation

int answer;
answer = 10;

if (string == "dynamic squid")
{
    print "hello " + string;
}
else if (string == "octopus")
{
    print "no";
}
else
{
    print "hi";
}
```

And I'm working on functions, but I don't know if I'll be done them by this weekend or not...
