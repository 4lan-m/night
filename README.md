# Night

A (interpreted?) programming language. Still in development. Don't really know what I'm doing, but it should work out in the end.

**Edit:**

I scrapped everything and restarted. Umm... I guess that's the learning process? I've never made a language before, so this might take a while.

However, I do have a good base now, so I should have like a bare minumun rough draft completed by this upcoming Sunday. Here's what I'm planning for my language to look like if I can finish it by next week:

```.cpp
// this is a comment
// don't even know if I'll have time to implement comments
// syntax is very similar to C++

char letter = 'c'
bool lightSwitch = true
int answer = 5 * 10 - 3

answer = 20
answer = answer + 20 // maybe I'll have time to do this?

// something like this?
stream console "Hello World"

// maybe I'll have enough time to make it so that you can print out variables
stream console answer
```

Here's a list:

**Features:**

- variables
  - char
  - bool
  - int
- expressions
  - arithmetic
  - boolean logic
- variable stuff
  - reassgin variables
  - be able to add on a value
- print
  - print chars, bools, and ints
  - print variables
  
Have to do all that in a week from scratch. Hopefully I can get at least half done.
